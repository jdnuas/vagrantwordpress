# vagrantwordpress
Default wordpress development virtual machine.

Welcome to vagrantwordpress - the defacto wordpress development environment for Victory Metroeast

The goal of this project is to standardized the development environment for wordpress projects within Victory Metroeast by providing a self contained virtual machine with an approximate specification of the production server used. No more "Works on my machine" excuse, no more plugin hunting or config editing. Happy developing
